Intro
-----

This module type of different streams.
In short a stream is something regulary or irregulary sampled : video, signal channels, digital
channels, events, ...

All stream use zmq socket to distribute new sample (or chunk of sample or image or chink of image).
Some stream use plain data socket (compress or not). Some other stream use a share mem
array view through numpy for convinience and only send the index of the new sample, this macanism 
avoid mem copy.

A stream can be synchronous or asynchronous depending of the source (aka driver of device).
If a device is real time them the packet sended in zmq are also "real time" as zmq is fast enough.


Stream list:

  * AnalogSignalSharedMemStream
  * AnalogSignalPlainDataStream
  * DigitalSignalSharedMemStream
